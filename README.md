Wireless Ranging Enabled Node (WREN) is a new low cost, TinyOS compatible platform. Our main goal is to create a scalable WSN for human contact data for disease spreading simulations. This platform solves several issues when compared to commercially available sensors, such as the TelosB and Irene, in scaling and rapid deployment strategies. It also requires little maintenance and does not need an existing support infrastructure.

The low cost and maintainability allow it to easily scale to a network of thousands of motes. It is built with consideration that the end user may not have technical/engineering knowledge of the system. Deploying a network this large takes less than one hour and recovery is just as simple, leading to a rapid data download process for fast, repeatable deployments.

The system has several proximity based use cases besides contact networks. Other features such as motion tracking using the accelerometer, radio strength signal indication (RSSI), and low power usage can be made advantageous for several projects.

The purpose of this Wiki is to provide the source for our hardware, software, and instructions to get the system up and running.
